# SMS Spam Classifier README

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as either spam or not spam (ham). The model has been trained on a dataset named 'spam.csv'. This README file provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up and running the model, and some additional information about the dataset and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is 'spam.csv'. This CSV file contains SMS messages labeled as either spam or not spam (ham). The dataset is split into two columns:
- `SMS`: The text of the SMS message.
- `Target`: The label indicating whether the SMS is spam (1) or not spam (0).

## Model Description
The machine learning model used in this project is a text classification model that leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine whether a given SMS message is spam or not. The model is based on a supervised learning approach and uses a combination of the following components:
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, lowercasing, and removing stop words and punctuation.
- Machine Learning Algorithm: Training a classification algorithm, such as  Support Vector Machine, on the processed text data.

## Setup Instructions
To set up and run the SMS spam classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```
   cd sms-spam-classifier
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Train the Model:
   - Use the 'train_model.py' script to train the model on the 'spam.csv' dataset. You can specify the hyperparameters and the choice of classification algorithm within this script.

5. Evaluate the Model:
   - Use the 'evaluate_model.py' script to evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset or using cross-validation. This script provides metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Make Predictions:
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new SMS messages using the 'predict.py' script.

## Model Performance
The model's performance can be evaluated using standard classification metrics, including:
- Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified SMS messages.
- Precision: The proportion of true spam messages among the predicted spam messages.
- Recall: The proportion of true spam messages that were correctly predicted.
- F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, which balances precision and recall.


## Future Improvements
Here are some potential areas for future improvements and enhancements to this SMS spam classifier:
- Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques.
- Explore different machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.
- Collect a larger and more diverse dataset for training.
- Implement real-time SMS classification in a web application or mobile app.

## Conclusion
This repository provides a simple SMS spam classifier trained on the 'spam.csv' dataset. By following the setup instructions and evaluating the model's performance, you can use this model to classify SMS messages as either spam or not spam. Feel free to customize and extend the model as needed for your specific use case.
